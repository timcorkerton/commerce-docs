! We had duplicate examples of this, need to consolidate. Both posted here.

For an actual example being used in Drupal Commerce, check out the state machine transition event subscriber being used in commerce_order to set an order's placed timestamp:
* [commerce_order.services.yml]
* [TimestampEventSubscriber.php]

Finding Transitions
-------------------

Transition information can be found in a `{module}.workflows.yml`.

Example from commerce_order:

```yaml
    # commerce_order.workflows.yml
    order_default:
      id: order_default
      group: commerce_order
      label: 'Default'
      states:
        draft:
          label: Draft
        completed:
          label: Completed
        canceled:
          label: Canceled
      transitions:
        place:
          label: 'Place order'
          from: [draft]
          to: completed
        cancel:
          label: 'Cancel order'
          from: [draft]
          to:   canceled
```

Reacting to Transitions
-----------------------

Example - reacting to the order 'place' transition.

```php
    // mymodule/src/EventSubscriber/MyModuleEventSubscriber.php
    namespace Drupal\my_module\EventSubscriber;

    use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;
    use Drupal\state_machine\Event\WorkflowTransitionEvent;

    class MyModuleEventSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface {

      public static function getSubscribedEvents() {
        // The format for adding a state machine event to subscribe to is:
        // {group}.{transition key}.pre_transition or {group}.{transition key}.post_transition
        // depending on when you want to react.
        $events = ['commerce_order.place.post_transition' => 'onOrderPlace'];
        return $events;
      }

      public function onOrderPlace(WorkflowTransitionEvent $event) {
        // @todo Write code that will run when the subscribed event fires.
      }
    }
```

Telling Drupal About Your Event Subscriber

Your event subscriber should be added to `{module}.services.yml` in the base directory of your module.

The following would register the event subscriber in the previous section:

```yaml
    # mymodule.services.yml
    services:
      my_module_event_subscriber:
        class: '\Drupal\my_module\EventSubscriber\MyModuleEventSubscriber'
        tags:
          - { name: 'event_subscriber' }
```


[commerce_order.services.yml]: https://github.com/drupalcommerce/commerce/blob/080ca52fbb9ec73b9eeece5487a62d221e75ed04/modules/order/commerce_order.services.yml#L29
[TimestampEventSubscriber.php]: https://github.com/drupalcommerce/commerce/blob/080ca52fbb9ec73b9eeece5487a62d221e75ed04/modules/order/src/EventSubscriber/TimestampEventSubscriber.php

Subscribing to Transition Events
--------------------------------

In many cases we may want to do more when a transition occurs than simply moving the order to the next state. Let's say that we want to send an email to the customer when an order has been processed and is awaiting for fulfillment. That should happen when a store manager clicks on the "Process order" button in the example above.

The state_machine module that provides the foundation for the workflows emits two events when a transition occurs. The events are named ``commerce_order.TRANSITION_ID.TRANSITION_PHASE``, where ``TRANSITION_ID`` is the key of the transition's definition in the YAML file, and ``TRANSITION_PHASE`` is "pre_transition" for the first event that is emitted just before the transition has occurred, and "post_transition" for the second event that is emitted just after it.

In our case we want to send the email after the transition to the Fulfillment state has occurred. We therefore need to create an event subscriber that listens to the ``commerce_order.fulfill.post_transition`` event.

Here is an example that you can modify according to your requirements.

```php
    // my_module/src/EventSubscriber/OrderFulfillmentSubscriber.php

    namespace Drupal\my_module\EventSubscriber;

    use Drupal\state_machine\Event\WorkflowTransitionEvent;
    use Drupal\Core\Language\LanguageManagerInterface;
    use Drupal\Core\Mail\MailManagerInterface;
    use Drupal\Core\StringTranslation\StringTranslationTrait;
    use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;

    /**
     * Sends an email when the order transitions to Fulfillment.
     */
    class OrderFulfillmentSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface {

      use StringTranslationTrait;

      /**
       * The language manager.
       *
       * @var \Drupal\Core\Language\LanguageManagerInterface
       */
      protected $languageManager;

      /**
       * The mail manager.
       *
       * @var \Drupal\Core\Mail\MailManagerInterface
       */
      protected $mailManager;

      /**
       * Constructs a new OrderFulfillmentSubscriber object.
       *
       * @param \Drupal\Core\Language\LanguageManagerInterface $language_manager
       *   The language manager.
       * @param \Drupal\Core\Mail\MailManagerInterface $mail_manager
       *   The mail manager.
       */
      public function __construct(
        LanguageManagerInterface $language_manager,
        MailManagerInterface $mail_manager
      ) {
        $this->languageManager = $language_manager;
        $this->mailManager = $mail_manager;
      }

      /**
       * {@inheritdoc}
       */
      public static function getSubscribedEvents() {
        $events = [
          'commerce_order.fulfill.post_transition' => ['sendEmail', -100],
        ];
        return $events;
      }

      /**
       * Sends the email.
       *
       * @param \Drupal\state_machine\Event\WorkflowTransitionEvent $event
       *   The transition event.
       */
      public function sendEmail(WorkflowTransitionEvent $event) {
        // Create the email.
        $order = $event->getEntity();
        $to = $order->getEmail();
        $params = [
          'from' => $order->getStore()->getEmail(),
          'subject' => $this->t(
            'Regarding your order [#@number]',
            ['@number' => $order->getOrderNumber()]
          ),
          'body' => $this->t(
            'Your order with #@number that you have placed with us has been processed and is awaiting fulfillment.',
            ['@number' => $order->getOrderNumber()]
          ),
        ];

        // Set the language that will be used in translations.
        if ($customer = $order->getCustomer()) {
          $langcode = $customer->getPreferredLangcode();
        }
        else {
          $langcode = $this->languageManager->getDefaultLanguage()->getId();
        }

        // Send the email.
        $this->mailManager->mail('commerce_order', 'receipt', $to, $langcode, $params);
        // commerce_order_mail hook seems to no longer exist - How do we now send emails?
      }

    }
```

Note that the following functions are made available by the event, if you need to execute more advanced logic based on the state that you are coming from or the workflow that the transition is part of.

```php
    $fromState = $event->getFromState();
    $toState = $event->getToState();
    $workflow = $event->getWorkflow();
```

At last, don't forget to register your event subscriber.

```yaml
    // my_module/my_module.services.yml

    services:
      my_module.order_fulfillment_subscriber:
        class: Drupal\my_module\EventSubscriber\OrderFulfillmentSubscriber
        arguments: ['@language_manager', '@plugin.manager.mail']
        tags:
          - { name: event_subscriber }
```
